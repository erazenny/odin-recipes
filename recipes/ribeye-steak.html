    <br>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>15oz Ribeye steak</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon of Himalayan Salt </li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon of Ground Black Pepper</li>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Garlic Cloves</li>
        <li>Rosemary and Thyme</li>
        <li>Time and Patience</li>
    </ul>
<br>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>An hour before cooking your steak, cover it with oil and season with salt <em>(LIGHTLY)</em> and pepper</li>
        <li>Put the steak in the fridge to get the moisture absorbed</li>
        <li>After an hour, take the steak out and let rest for 30 minutes</li>
        <li>Get a cast iron skillet (it doesn't have to be a cast iron but it works), put it on the stove, and turn the heat to high.<br>
        (To make sure the pan in ready, pour a few droplets of water to the pan; 
        if it beads around that means the steak is ready to sear)
        </li>
        <li>Add oil to the pan and then place the ribeye onto the pan</li>
        <li>After 3 minutes, flip sides</li>
        <li>After two minutes, take the pan off the heat and add your aromatics (butter, thyme, rosemary, garlic) </li>
        <li>Lean the pan a bit to the side, grab a spoon and start scooping the button and pouring on the steak (repeatedly) </li>
        <li>After a minute, flip and repeat the basting process</li>
        <li>Take your ribeye off the pan and put on a cutting board (wooded preferably) </li>
        <li>OPTIONAL: if you have the patience, let rest for about 5-7 minutes for the juices to really hold in</li>
    </ol>
